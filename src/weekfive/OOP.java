	 * FOUR Pillars of OOP: 
	 * 1. Abstraction 
	 * 		a triangle is an abstract concept. You may not know how big it is but, that it has 3 angles. Properties that 
	 * define a triangle. We don't need to know all the properties of triangle to know it's a triangle. Essential features 
	 * of a entity that we know about. 
	 * 
	 * 2. Encapsulation 
	 * 		Is hiding the inner workings of our code so that certain methods are only accessible to certain areas of our code. 
	 * This allows us that certain classes or objects are not used in a way not supposed to be used. Example: If you are 
	 * driving a car we are only taught how to drive (public user interface) a car (gas, brake, steering etc) and the user does not need to know how to fire the cylinders and 
	 * make the motor move. Thats all encapsulated (private) under the hood that the user doesn't necessarily need to understand in order to 
	 * drive. 
	 * 
	 * 3. Inheritance 
	 * 		Just like we inherit traits from our parents. Allows objects or Classes to inherit from parent classes. 
	 * 
	 * 4. Polymorphism 
	 * 		Animals communicate in different ways 
	 * 		The "method" communicate can take different forms
	 * 
	 * The tool we have to structure our code in OOP is a CLASS 
	 * 
	 * Class - like a blueprint 
	 * Object - The actual product developed from the blueprint 
	 * An object is an instance of a class.
